To install the C++ script that demonstrates how you can create a cross-platform artificial intelligence program named "Menace" using the CMUSphinx API to recognize speech, perform tasks based on the recognized text, modify its own code, stay connected to all devices, show the locations of the devices, and ask if a default app should be set if it is found on your Arch Linux system, you will need to follow these steps:

    Make sure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. You will need the PocketSphinx and SphinxBase libraries, as well as the CMUSphinx API. You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

sudo pacman -S pocketsphinx sphinxbase

Create a new directory for the script, and navigate to it.

mkdir menace
cd menace

Save the script to a file named menace.cpp in the new directory.
Compile the script using the following command:

    g++ -o menace menace.cpp -l pocketsphinx -lsphinxbase -lsphinxad

    This will create an executable file named menace in the current directory.
    Run the script by typing ./menace and pressing Enter.

You may also need to modify the script to ensure that it works correctly on your system. For example, you may need to modify the file paths used in the script, or you may need to modify the commands used to open the default web browser and music player.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
